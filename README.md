# UART Communication Program Readme

This is a C program for UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication on the MKL05Z4 microcontroller. The program demonstrates basic UART communication by sending and receiving characters. Here's a brief overview of the code and how to use it:

## Description

- The program initializes the MKL05Z4 microcontroller, configures the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) module, and sets up the necessary pins for UART communication.
- It prompts the user to enter a login string, reads and echoes the characters entered, and stores them in an array.
- After successfully receiving the login string twice, the program generates a beep to indicate completion.
- The program enters an infinite loop at the end, suitable for an embedded application.

## Code Structure

- `MCUInit`: Initializes the microcontroller's clock settings and disables the watchdog timer.
- `PinInit`: Configures the necessary pins for UART communication.
- `UART0Init`: Initializes the UART module with a baud rate of 115200, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.
- `SendCh`: Sends a single character via UART after waiting for the transmit buffer to be ready.
- `ReceiveCh`: Receives a single character via UART after checking for incoming data.
- `SendStr`: Sends a null-terminated string via UART by calling `SendCh` for each character in the string.
- `delay`: Implements a simple delay function using a loop.
- `beep`: Generates a beep sound by toggling a GPIO pin.
- `main`: The main function of the program, which performs the UART communication.

## How to Use

1. Build and flash this code to the MKL05Z4 microcontroller using an appropriate development environment or toolchain.
2. Connect a UART terminal (such as Tera Term, PuTTY, or the terminal emulator of your choice) to the microcontroller's UART pins.
3. Open the terminal and configure it to match the UART settings (115200 baud rate, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
4. Upon starting the microcontroller, it will prompt you to enter a login string. Enter the string "xlogin00" as instructed.
5. The microcontroller will echo the characters you enter and store them in an array. Once it receives the login string twice, it will generate a beep.
6. You can modify the login string or other aspects of the program as needed for your application.

Please note that this code serves as a basic example of UART communication and can be further extended and adapted to meet the requirements of your specific project or application.
